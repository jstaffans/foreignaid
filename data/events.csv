That is, to independently develop those local communities in which they work. The partners of Fida around India are mainly large local churches, but also a group of volunteers is involved. The on-going training programme is a direct result of the partners’ own call for assistance and support to help them to independently do community development work. One indicator of the programme’s success is the excellent team spirit that exists between the partners at all levels. Through this programme the partners gain professional know-how and tools for implementing community development projects as well as training at various levels. Special attention is paid to motivating the partners towards working with the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people groups within their society. As the partners’ knowledge and skills in community development build up, they in turn can train their partnering communities in e.g. health and gender questions, micro enterprise know-how and environmental issues. This, again, will lead towards improvement in the social and economic status of the local people.",645,160

The on-going training programme is a direct result of the partners’ own call for assistance and support to help them to independently do community development work. One indicator of the programme’s success is the excellent team spirit that exists between the partners at all levels. Through this programme the partners gain professional know-how and tools for implementing community development projects as well as training at various levels. Special attention is paid to motivating the partners towards working with the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people groups within their society. As the partners’ knowledge and skills in community development build up, they in turn can train their partnering communities in e.g. health and gender questions, micro enterprise know-how and environmental issues.

The Community Development Programme, which was started at the beginning of this year, aims to train and give guidance to local partners for independent community work. That is, the goal is to equip the partners with the skills and knowledge needed to develop those local communities in which they work. The Programme is a continuation of two separate community development projects that took place in 2004–2006 and were carried out in partnership with two local churches. Despite their small size and limited capacities, the churches partnering with Fida are eager to continue development work independently in the local communities.

The project aims at building up the capacity of the local partner to run a sustainable youth ministry on the islands of Pemba, Zanzibar and Mafia. The youth on the Tanzanian islands lack sufficient vocational training and they have poor life management skills. Unemployment rate is high and drug abuse is common among the youth. To address the situation, the Free Pentecostal Church of Tanzania (FPCT) and Fida began youth work on the islands in 1998. Fida and FPCT have established youth centres on Zanzibar and Pemba. Now a new centre will be established also on Mafia. These centres, run by FPCT, offer the youth vocational training, constructive free-time activities and information on e.g. health issues and life skills. Through the project, the capacity of FPCT to run the youth centres in a sustainable way increases and the centres will be able to become independent. As a result of the activities run in the centres, the life management skills of the youth living on the islands will improve. ",282,112

The aim of these cooperatives is to produce pure seed potato for those cooperative farms in the Province, which grow food potato.  The government of North Korea promotes potato production as a major element in enhancing food security in the country. The project provides the cooperatives with hands-on training in potato production through experimental potato farming. A great deal of attention is also paid to ensuring existence of sufficient storage facilities and effective distribution systems. Through the project the cooperatives will improve their capacities in seed and food potato farming. As the potato farming at the cooperatives improves, the nutritional base that currently relies much on rice alone will become more varied.

Through the capacity-building provided by the trainers, the people living in the three communities learn to identify and utilize local resources, improve the health situation in the communities and initiate community development projects.

Most of them find themselves in the growing slum areas of the country’s major cities. For children in particular the future does not look bright and many of them end up as street children. Fida and its partner, Asembleas de Dios (AdD) church, work especially among children. The programme offers potential street children an opportunity to attend AdD founded schools that are supported through child sponsorship. These schools, located in Bogotá, provide also an excellent channel for AdD to participate in improving the social environment in the area. The programme is currently expanding to other parts of Colombia, and in this process motivating and training local churches is important. Through the practical work and trainings carried out as part of the programme the capacity of the partner to do efficient social work increases. At the same time especially children’s schooling opportunities improve. This sort of development, in turn, will improve the partner’s influence in the Colombian society in general.",437,151

The project seeks to address the needs of the youth in Mitrovica and Vushtrri through empowering a local partner for effective youth work. For the past 15 years the educational opportunities for the youth of Kosovo have been very scarce; first due to Yugoslavian government regulations and then due to the prolonged political conflict. Now, without sufficient education, a whole generation of youth has lost their hope for future. Fida partners with the Protestant Evangelical Church to improve the situation. The project started in 2000 with one youth centre in the city of Mitrovica and soon another centre was established in Vushtrri. The youth centres offer a wide variety of activities and training for up to 2000 youth annually, e.g. English classes, computer training and sports events. Through organizing the activities, the local partner gets hands-on training in youth work. Through the work done at the centres, the skills of the local partner in youth work will increase. The centres provide the youth with meaningful leisure time activities and training in various subjects that play an important role when continuing to further education. As a consequence the overall life management skills of the youth will improve.",63,112

As the people in the villages learn new skills and are encouraged to take initiative, they become willing and able to develop their own communities. And as they begin to take action, the quality of life in the communities improves.

The main approach of the programme is that of Community Health Education (CHE). Through the programme the village communities gain courage as well as practical tools and know-how for developing their own communities. For instance, Community Health Educators are trained and self-help groups formed in each village, and youth (men and women) are trained in vocational skills. As the people in the villages learn new skills and are encouraged to take initiative, they become willing and able to develop their own communities. And as they begin to take action, the quality of life in the communities improves. In several villages the increased attitude of self-help has already led to a great deal of improvements in e.g. children’s school attendance, adult literacy, livelihood skills and means, and prevention of common diseases.",645,160

As the partners’ skills and knowledge on micro enterprise projects increase, they can begin establishing micro enterprise projects of their own all over the country. The aim is to have 60 micro enterprises established. Through micro enterprise projects job opportunities in local communities will increase. This, again, will lead towards improvement in the livelihood conditions in the local communities.",645,160

In addition to the safe-house, which is supported through child sponsorship, the programme now includes various components. The programme offers training for the partner in e.g. Community Health Education (CHE) and HIV/AIDS questions. Adult education in the local Maasai communities is also an essential part of the programme. Maasai girls are also supported and encouraged to enter high school and postgraduate studies, when possible.
